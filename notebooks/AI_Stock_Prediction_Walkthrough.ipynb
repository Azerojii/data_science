    "# 🤖 AI Stock Prediction: A Beginner's Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook will guide you through the **entire AI process** used in your project. We will take raw stock prices and turn them into a machine learning model that can predict future price movements (specifically for high-volatility stocks like SMCI, CRSP, PLTR).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will verify every step to ensure **no future data leakage** (cheating) occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 What we will cover:\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Loading your project code.\n",
    "2. **Data Ingestion**: Getting the raw stock prices.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating \"Features\" (Technical Indicators) that the AI learns from.\n",
    "4. **Data Preparation**: Creating \"Rolling Windows\" to organize data for the AI.\n",
    "5. **Model Training**: Training an **XGBoost** model (a very powerful AI algorithm).\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Checking if the model actually works (Precision, Backtesting).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Setup & Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import standard Python libraries (like pandas for data tables) and link this notebook to your existing code in the `src/` folder."
